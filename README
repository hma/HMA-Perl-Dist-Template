HMA::Perl::Dist::Template
=========================

This is HMA's personal template for creating object-oriented Perl
modules/distributions the way he likes.

Perhaps I won't need it anymore when I get to learn how to use
Dist::Zilla (http://dzil.org/) or similar advanced tools.


DISCLAIMER

DO NOT INSTALL this module. It's just a template, really.
